<h2>Introduction</h2>

It is inspired from <a href="http://lumberjocks.com/jayman7">Jayman7</a>'s excellent <a href="http://www.lastalias.com/cbdesigner/">cbdesigner</a> Windows program and provides much of the same functionality as a web based application, which allows its use on macs, chromebooks and tablets.
